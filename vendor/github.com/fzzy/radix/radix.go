// Radix is a simple redis driver. This top-level package is a wrapper for its
// two sub-packages: redis, which contains the single-connection redis client
// (the most commonly used part of this package) and extra, which contains other
// sub-packages for doing things like pooling connections and interacting with a
// redis cluster.
